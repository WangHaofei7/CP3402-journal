After finishing the practical, I completed some LinkedIn Learning courses to ensure I understood everything there is to know about child themes, 
which I thought could be helpful for a group project. This week, I built up a child theme based on the WordPress Twenty Twenty theme.

This week, excluding the time I spent on homework, I worked on this problem for almost four hours.
Child themes helped me understand the fundamentals of WordPress theme development without requiring me to start from scratch. 
I also took a modest step into PHP, and now that I've studied for a week, I feel much more comfortable using PHP. 
I discovered that PHP is quite similar to Java (which I have some respectable expertise with) and that variables are generated in PHP using the $ symbol.
I began looking at the LinkedIn Learning subtopic courses after finishing the practicals to see if they offered any more insights that I hadn't learned from the practicals. 
I did learn some things that I wouldn't have otherwise learned, such as some more sophisticated CSS that I hadn't studied in web design, which I believe will be very helpful when I go on and add more details to my website. 
Based on this week's learning strategy, I came to the conclusion that while this approach to learning can be successful, I find that, as I mentioned the previous week, it is more useful for me to look at the guide, do some work, 
and then return to the lesson.
