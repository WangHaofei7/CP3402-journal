Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I used Joomla to create a new web page with a theme centered on Eason Guitar Studio. During my learning and usage of Joomla, I faced several challenges. For instance, to download the complete Joomla component, I needed to connect to MySQL on my personal computer, which presented some issues. Ultimately, I resorted to using the web page editor to modify my site, but I still encountered difficulties. For example, the default template in Joomla, called Cassiopeia, had many elements that I couldn't edit, despite trying numerous solutions and consulting various resources. Here is the link.

Estimated Hours this Week
I spent at least 10 hours on this project, which included researching solutions to my problems and learning how to use Joomla effectively.

Content Insights
Joomla proved to be a powerful component this week. As an open-source platform, Joomla allows anyone to view, modify, and distribute its source code, fostering a large developer community that drives its continuous development. It offers a rich array of extensions and templates, making it highly adaptable for various website needs. Numerous third-party developers create plugins, modules, and themes for Joomla, enhancing its scalability and customization to meet the specific requirements of different websites.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week's studies have taught me a new method of website creation, which I find to be a valuable skill. With further in-depth study, I plan to compare Joomla and WordPress, as both have unique advantages. Understanding the strengths of each platform will enable me to choose the most appropriate tools to meet different needs in my future work.
