Content Insights
During this week, I learned the importance of choosing the right tools for team collaboration. Slack proved to be an effective platform for communication, while GitHub was essential for version control and collaborative coding. Trello, with its flexibility and user-friendly interface, was ideal for task management and project planning.

We chose Trello over GitHub Projects for its user-friendly interface and flexibility in task management. One of our team members copied the template board and customized it to our project's needs.

Next Steps: Project Planning: We will continue to refine our project plan, ensuring that each team member has clear tasks and responsibilities.

Skills Development: Beyond technical skills in CMS and hosting, we aim to cultivate soft skills like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are equally critical in a collaborative project.
