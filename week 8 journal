Learning Journal for Week8
Learning Activities & Resources
Experiment Description Theory: Utilizing spaced repetition in studying CMS content will enhance my retention and understanding compared to continuous study sessions.

Test: To test this theory, I will alternate between studying new CMS material and revising previous weeks' content. I plan to use an app for spaced repetition, scheduling reviews of past topics at increasing intervals, while also dedicating time to new material. This approach contrasts with my previous method of focusing solely on new content each week.

Methodology:

Preparation: Gather all study materials from the past weeks, including notes, practical exercises, and additional resources.
Implementation:
Day 1-3: Study new Week 8 content for two hours daily.
Day 4: Review Week 5 content using spaced repetition techniques.
Day 5: Continue with new Week 8 material.
Day 6: Review Week 6 content.
Day 7: Finalize Week 8 studies and review Week 7 content.
Documentation: Keep a detailed log of study times, topics covered, and self-assessment scores before and after each review session.

Content Insights
The initial phase of this experiment highlighted the potential benefits of spaced repetition. It was surprising to notice how quickly I could recall information from Week 5, which initially seemed challenging. Balancing new and old content kept the study sessions engaging and diverse, potentially reducing the monotony often associated with continuous study.

Experiment Outcomes
Increased Retention: The spaced repetition method seemed to enhance my recall of earlier topics. Balanced Learning: This method allowed a more holistic approach to learning, ensuring I did not neglect past content while learning new material.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This learning experiment not only provided insights into more effective study techniques but also emphasized the importance of adaptability in learning methods. In a fast-evolving field like CMS and web development, the ability to quickly assimilate new information while retaining previous knowledge is crucial. Such skills are not just academic but are directly translatable to a professional environment, where continuous learning and adaptation are key.
